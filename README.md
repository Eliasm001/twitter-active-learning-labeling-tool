# Active Learning for Tweet Sentiment Classification

### Project summary

With this tool it's a breeze for users to create tailored datasets of tweets about a desired topic, manage created datasets and subsequently label tweets efficiently thanks to Active Learning. The project employs the Twitter API to fetch the necessary tweets and Flask to run the app.

### Utility

The user is being equipped with an intuitive and user-friendly tool, which guides him through all the steps needed to obtain a labeled set of tweets. Unlike many existing solutions, our tool makes use of Active Learning. This allows for increased productivity. During the process of labeling, the achieved progress is being displayed and last but not least the user gains further inside into the makeup of his dataset through an analytics page.

The tool tool uses the python flask framework for the backend with a html, css, JavaScript frontend and can be deployed on a webserver or run on localhost.

To run the app, install the requirements.txt files, navigate into the folder containing app.py and type flask run into your console window.
